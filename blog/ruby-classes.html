		<h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
		<h4>10.17.15</h4>
		<p>
			This week, the concept that wins the most points for frustration-building, confusion-inducing, and error-creating is the Ruby class... Class.<br><br>

      Take a look at an example class in action below:
		</p>

		<p><pre><code>class MusicPlayer
  def initialize(songs)
    @playlist = songs
    return raise ArgumentError.new("Number of songs should be greater than 0.") if @playlist.keys.count < 1
  end

  def play
    @playlist.each do |song, artist|
      puts "Now Playing: \"#{song}\" by \"#{artist}\""
      sleep 1.0
    end
    puts "By the way, what an excellent taste in music!"
  end
end


# Driver Code
songs = {"Needn't Speak" => "Rudimental", "Headlights" => "Ivy & Gold", "Turn Around" => "Rundfunk", "Rumored to Be Real" => "Bee's Knees"}

new_session = MusicPlayer.new(songs)
new_session.play


# Output
# Now Playing: "Needn't Speak" by "Rudimental"
# Now Playing: "Headlights" by "Ivy & Gold"
# Now Playing: "Turn Around" by "Rundfunk"
# Now Playing: "Rumored to Be Real" by "Bee's Knees"
# By the way, what an excellent taste in music!

</code></pre>
    </p>

      <span class="important">Let's analyze what's happening from the top down.</span><br><br>
      1. We are starting with a class titled MusicPlayer. Every object inside this class should in theory represent an attribute of a music player as we know it. Every method inside this class should represent a functionality of a music player when we interact with one.<br><br>
      2. To initialize this class, we define initialize, which is a method that takes one argument called "songs". (What good is a music player if it has no songs to play?)<br><br>
      3. In the next line, I created an <span class="important">instance variable</span> called @playlist and stored the songs input in it. This functions just like any other variable, except that it has an expanded scope. I'm able to use @playlist in any method inside this class, making information sharing a lot easier.<br><br>
      4. Next we have an optional argument error. In this instance, it is triggered if the user provides an empty songs input.<br><br>
      5. (Disclaimer: Yes, this is an extremely humble version of playing through a playlist.)<br>
      In the second definition, we see an <span class="important">instance method</span> called play. Instance methods can be called on new instances of a class. This is opposed to <span class="important">class methods</span>, which are methods that can only be called on the class object itself. In our example here, the instance method "play" takes the information from our instance variable @playlist, loops through each song title and artist name, then outputs them out one by one with a 1 second delay between each puts that is meant to represent the song playing.<br>(Our music player then momentarily gains sentience in order to tell us how great our music is.)<br><br>
      6. Beneath the class definition, we have our "driver code" or <span class="important">test code</span>. In sum, this is where we provide the class initialization input, create a new instance of the class, and call our instance methods on the new class instance.<br><br>
      7. First, I provided the "songs" hash input. I chose the hash collection over an array collection object in order to easily store both song titles and artist names.<br><br>
      8. Second, I created a "new_session" variable that stores our new MusicPlayer instance.<br>
      A new class instance can always be created like so: <pre><code>class_object.new(argument)</code></pre>
      9. Third, I called our instance method "play" on our newly minted class instance new_session, and this generated the output that we see in the output section. That's all!<br><br>
      
      If we had created a class method "play" like so: <pre><code class="ruby">def self.play</code></pre><br> then we would have had to call it on our class object directly like so: <pre><code class="ruby">MusicPlayer.play</code></pre>
