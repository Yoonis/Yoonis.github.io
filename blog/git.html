      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
      Version control is critical because projects call for multiple members to a team. It's not possible to always be collaborating side by side, so aach member will be working with their own local copies. Keeping tabs on all copies allows each team member to work with autonomy, and the team will still be able to maintain a master copy of everyone's collective, merged work at the end of the day.

      Another important advantage comes in if new code introduces bugs. Version control allows the team to rollback to their latest, functioning version while they work to fix the bug.

        <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
        git allows the user to push incremental commits to the remote repo. All commits are saved to a history, which can be viewed on GitHub or by typing git log on the CLI.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
        GitHub is a central hub that all team members can access to collaborate on projects. Fully merged, master versions of code can be pulled, updated, and stored at any time.
