<b>1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</b>  

I learned different border stylings, and I learned how to pad and add margins to benefit the layout of my elements. I found that modifying margins by percentage was more flexible than by a set pixel amount.

<b>2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?</b>  

I learned that fixed positioning makes formatting footers and copyrights easy. I learned that static positioning is implied. Absolute and relative positioning were more finicky to use and understand, but luckily I didn't have much need to incorporate these 2 position types during the making of my website.

<b>3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</b>  

I made a mood board last week, but decided to scrap the ideas and start fresh. It took a bit of playing around before I could settle on a satisfactory default.css design.  

Font and color styles were the easiest to implement (but may have also taken the longest due to indecision). I had some trouble getting floats and positions to cooperate, and I also learned that I have to be very specific with my CSS selectors in order to manipulate the exact elements I needed to. 

<b>4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</b>  

I learned that all styling should be done in CSS, not in HTML, even though it would seem easier to add a simple line break in HTML once and be done with it. For all the beauty that CSS brings, there are quite a number of features I can't implement right now without Javascript, such as sorting blog posts by date. My biggest concern is having a nav menu on every site page without having to manually update this menu in every single HTML file, but right now I am copy pasting updates across all files.
